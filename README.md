# An Evaluating NLP and ML Techniques for Banglish Text Error Detection
Designed a project centered around conducting a comparative analysis of various NLP and ML models to enhance the accuracy of Banglish text.

In this project, five distinct machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including SVM, MultinomialNB, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, are implemented and compared using a self-made dataset. The comparison is based on various features, and the evaluation is performed using a set of metrics with the goal of identifying the most suitable model for error detection.
